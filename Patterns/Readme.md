## Introduction

The repository is a collection of pattern printing programs, useful for learning and practicing control structures like loops and conditionals. These programs are commonly asked in coding interviews and help in building problem-solving skills.

### Types of Patterns Covered:
- **Number patterns** (e.g., triangular numbers, inverted numbers)
- **Star/asterisk patterns** (e.g., pyramid, diamond, hollow pyramid)
- **Alphabet patterns** (e.g., alphabetical triangle, cross patterns)
- **Mixed shape patterns** (combination of symbols and numbers)

The repository aims to help beginners strengthen their understanding of loops, nested loops, and conditionals in **[C Language]**.
